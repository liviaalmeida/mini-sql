# ðŸš€ Welcome to mini-sql

This project was created using [**jison**](https://github.com/zaach/jison) but now it runs on [**jiwson**](https://github.com/fraczak/jiwson) so it's compatible to ES6.

You can run

```console
npm install mini-sql
```

or

```console
yarn add mini-sql
```

and then bundle the parser to your application in a simple way:

```javascript
import parser from 'mini-sql'
```
